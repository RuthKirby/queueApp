Queuing app 
Live Demo - https://queueapp.herokuapp.com/
------------------
This project is a 'Queue' application. Information about visitors (resident, organisation or unknown) is inputted, stored and displayed in a table showing the position of each visitor in a queue. 

Design Decisions 
------------------
Information on who is in the queue gathered by a HTML form (Bootstrap) and is persisted into a MySQL database and accessed using PHP. 

Example Use 
------------------
Could be used by front of house staff at a Council/local government office who need
to organise and handle administration for residents or organisations who have come
in to discuss local services

Possible Improvements 
-------------------
- A 'Delete' button for when a person in the queue has been seen.
- A Timestamp for when the person arrived.
