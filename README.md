Design Decisions 
------------------
I decided to go with MySQL and PHP for the queue app.
Due to some problems moving the app from my university
server where I developed it to Github/Heroku I think
going with Firebase's real time database would have 
been a better choice. However, I learned a lot moving
from the secure and prepared development enviroment of
university to my own.
